# Movie Finder Xtreme
Created a program that can through different kinds of input provide you with search results of movies/TV-shows. Using API provided by TMDB.
Will with this file try to give a better understand of the structure of my program.

Stay safe sailors!

## Classes 
### Movie
This class was created by sending a request through postman to get information output as Json. This to enable search function by Movie IDs through TMDB API.
******
### MovieTitle
This class was constructed in the same way as the class "Movie". This was to enable the function where you may search after a movie by title. 
******
### LoginMenu
This Class is exactly what it says, the first thing you see when the program starts. I made this class to make enable an easier overview of the code-structure.
Basically you get alternatives on how to continue, and this class will also verify your login credentials. 
******
### MainMenu
This is the next step in the program. Basically here just to simplify life. Makes it easy to read the steps in the code, and what the intended job for each class are.
Here you get the opportunity to choose how you'd like to proceed on how to use the program, i.e how you'd like to search for movies.
******
### User
No surprises here. This Class is made up out of variables and constructs to create user profiles. 
******
### Methods
Now this is a beauty. This class is the key to the whole program. I made this class early on in my work to try and group up all the different kinds of methods i'd need throughout all the classes. This made it easier for me to get an overview of what I had and what I lacked.
Being the backbone in the code this is where I spent most of my time. Thanks to this class it was also easy to know where to look when things didn't go my way.
******
### Other
I hope you enjoy using this program. All credit to TMDB for such a simple API to use and for the massive amount of documentation available to learn from.
If you come across any errors that can be adjusted please leave a note to my assistant.

Much love!
